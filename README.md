Someone asked me to release extension on GitHub and I did so. I've never thought I will show its sources though, hope you'll be okay with my shitty code.

This extension uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 2.2.4, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 4.0.0 alpha 2, [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) 4.0.5, [UAParser](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js) 0.7.10, [clipboard.js](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js) 1.5.12 and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) 4.6.3.

## Latest release - 1.6.0.0 - July 13, 2016
* You are now able to test the volume of notifications at the options page
* Added "Copy item name" and "Copy item chat code" buttons.
* Item names are now links which lead to GW2Wiki.
* Added more information to contacts page.
* Added a new button â€” "Detailed info". By pressing this one you can see item's detailed trading post information.
* Fixed a bug when after switching between API keys you get a lot of notifications. Your transaction data is now deleted after switching API key. It's very hard to make the extension work with multiple API keys.
