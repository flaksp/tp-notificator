# Guild Wars 2 Trading Post Notificator
You can get it at [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fmfminppfcknlpekeffahpnpfahmhojk) now for Google Chrome, Google Chrome Canary and Chromium.

Someone asked me to release extension on GitHub and I did so. I've never thought I will show its sources though, hope you'll be okay with my shitty code.

This extenstion uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 2.2.1, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 4.0.0 alpha 2, [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) 4.0.5 and [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) 4.5.0.

## Latest release - 1.4.1.0 - March 21, 2016
### Enhancements
* Removed a button from exchange rate notifications which stopped those notifications. You can stop notifications by pressing Ã— button now.

### Fixes
* Fixed a bug when the extension window blinks after you switch between tabs too often.
* Fixed a bug with gem price notifications.
