# Guild Wars 2 Trading Post Notificator
You can get it at [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fmfminppfcknlpekeffahpnpfahmhojk) now for Google Chrome, Google Chrome Canary and Chromium.

Someone asked me to release extension on GitHub and I did so. I've never thought I will show its sources though, hope you'll be okay with my shitty code.

This extenstion uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 2.2.1, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 4.0.0 alpha 2, [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) 4.0.5 and [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) 4.5.0.

## Latest release - 1.4.0.0 - March 5, 2016
### Enhancements
* You can get notifications when gems or gold exchange rates are profitable for you.
* Added a link to graphs for gem exchange rate. Works only if you've selected any graph tool in your settings.
* Settings are not syncing between Chrome accounts and browsers anymore. Every browser can get personal settings now. But API-keys are still syncing.
* Added a new option which allows you to define a default page which will appear when you open the extension.
* Optimization improvements.
* Updated jQuery to 2.2.1.

### Fixes
* Minor bugfixes.
