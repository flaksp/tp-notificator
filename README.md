# Guild Wars 2 Trading Post Notificator

> **Note:** There will be no new features in this project because its code is horrible and unsupportable. Only bugs will be fixed. When I developed this I didn't even know about NPM! Maybe in the distant future I'll create a brand new extension based on modern technologies and crystal clear code.

You can get it at extension stores now:
* [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fmfminppfcknlpekeffahpnpfahmhojk) &mdash; Google Chrome, Google Chrome Canary, Chromium and Yandex.Browser
* [Opera Store](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/guild-wars-2tm-trading-post-notificator/) &mdash; Opera 15+

Someone asked me to release extension on GitHub and I did so. I've never thought I will show its sources though, hope you'll be okay with my shitty code.

This extension uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 2.2.4, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 4.0.0 alpha 3, [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) 4.0.5, [UAParser](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js) 0.7.10, [clipboard.js](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js) 1.5.12, [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) 4.6.3 and [Highstock](http://www.highcharts.com/) 4.2.6.

## Latest release - 1.7.2.1 - September 16, 2017

* Fixed bug with text disappearing.
